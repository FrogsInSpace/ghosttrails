CHANGELOG
=========

BETA 5
------

  - Have the spline in 3dsmax4-style particle systems automatically
    orient itself to follow the path of the particle's motion.

  - Particle Trails are now enabled in "demo" mode for unregistered users.
    Trails will only be calculated for frames 0 to 50.
    
  - Make "U Repeat" parameter work for the Age Mapping.


BETA 4
------

  - Bug Fix: If anchored trails were used GT would crash 3dsmax if the 
    referenced particle system changed.
    
  - Change "Spline Steps" minimum to 0 (was 1).
