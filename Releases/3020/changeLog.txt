CHANGELOG
=========

3.0.2.0
-------


  - Bug Fix: Setting a range on anchored trails was broken (since RC2)


3.0.1.0
-------

  - Smoothly interpolate particle trails in subframe intervals.

RC 2
----

  - Bug Fix: Particle trails not working if active time segment
    started at a frame other than 0.

BETA 6
------

  - Bug Fix: Instanced GT modifiers now work. 
  - Can generate trails for a subset of particle flow events
  - Can now generate trails for every n'th particle
  - Extend beta period to end of June '04


BETA 5
------

  - Have the spline in 3dsmax4-style particle systems automatically
    orient itself to follow the path of the particle's motion.

  - Particle Trails are now enabled in "demo" mode for unregistered users.
    Trails will only be calculated for frames 0 to 50.
    
  - Make "U Repeat" parameter work for the Age Mapping.


BETA 4
------

  - Bug Fix: If anchored trails were used GT would crash 3dsmax if the 
    referenced particle system changed.
    
  - Change "Spline Steps" minimum to 0 (was 1).
