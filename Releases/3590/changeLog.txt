CHANGELOG
=========

3.5.9.0 (64-bit only)
-------

	- Fixed threading bug which would cause 3dsmax to intermittently
	  crash when regenerating particle trails on multi-core systems.
	  There is no longer a pop-up progress dialog for particle trail 
	  generation and it is currently not possible to cancel an in-progress
	  regeneration.

3.5.8.0 (64-bit only)
-------

	- Added debug logging option to help disgnose crash bugs

3.5.7.0 (64-bit only)
-------

	- Fix a bug where having items in the Particle Flow event list
	  would prevent the trail from rendering.

3.5.6.0
-------

	- Increase maximum for segments per frame from 10 to 10000
	- Tidy up registration dialog so "go to site" button works.

3.5.5.0
-------

	- Fix bug which broke GT mesh generation when image motion blur
	  was used at the start or end of the active time segment.

3.5.4.0
-------

	- Fix bug with not responding to cache dump messages from dependent
	  particle systems. This was causing crashes during rendering of
	  particle trails.

3.5.3.0
-------

    - Rebuild for 3dsmax2010 32 and 64-bit. 

3.5.2.0
-------

    - Add ability to control the number of material IDs assigned
	  to particle trails.

	- Add MaxScript access to the "Recalulate Trails" button 
	  (eg "$.modifiers[#GhostTrails].regenerate_particle_trails()")

    - Fix a problem with render crashes with instanced GT modifiers.

3.5.1.0
-------

	- Fix problem with mesh generation when frames to lag was set
	  to 0 or below. Seems to only affect 3dsmax2008.

3.5.0.0
-------
     
	- 3dsmax9/3dsmax2008 64-bit build.
	- Fix a crash bug in 3dsmax9 when an incorrect reg code was entered.
	- Add string/stretch mapping.

3.0.9.0
-------

	- 3dsmax9 build (32-bit only).

3.0.8.0
-------

  - Make anchored trail mapping faster and more correct.
  - Increase start/end spinner ranges to 10m ticks (about 600000 frames).

3.0.7.0
-------

  - Fix bug that could crash 3dsmax when the "About" dialog was closed.

3.0.6.0
-------

  - Change start and end frame spinners for anchored trails to respect the 
    current time unit (SMPTE, ticks etc.). Change is NOT backwards compatible.
    Times will not be converted to/from the older format (files will load but the
    times will be wrong).

3.0.5.0
-------

  - Bug Fix: Reset TM to current frame after calcs to prevent loops when
             binding to space warps.

3.0.4.0
-------

  - Bug Fix: U-Repeat not working properly
  - Bug Fix: Anchored trail UV calculation didn't take parent transform into account.

3.0.3.0
-------

  - Bug Fix: Copied GT modifiers still referred to the original Object.

3.0.2.0
-------

  - Bug Fix: Setting a range on anchored trails was broken (since RC2)


3.0.1.0
-------

  - Smoothly interpolate particle trails in subframe intervals.

RC 2
----

  - Bug Fix: Particle trails not working if active time segment
    started at a frame other than 0.

BETA 6
------

  - Bug Fix: Instanced GT modifiers now work. 
  - Can generate trails for a subset of particle flow events
  - Can now generate trails for every n'th particle
  - Extend beta period to end of June '04


BETA 5
------

  - Have the spline in 3dsmax4-style particle systems automatically
    orient itself to follow the path of the particle's motion.

  - Particle Trails are now enabled in "demo" mode for unregistered users.
    Trails will only be calculated for frames 0 to 50.
    
  - Make "U Repeat" parameter work for the Age Mapping.


BETA 4
------

  - Bug Fix: If anchored trails were used GT would crash 3dsmax if the 
    referenced particle system changed.
    
  - Change "Spline Steps" minimum to 0 (was 1).
